html website scraper 

you are given a url 
from that url you are supposed to get that particular page's full html 

on the home page there should be an input for the url
there should also be a button to start the process

once you have submitted the url it gets added to the list of urls that you have already ran before
on the right side there should be a status badge with the status on the completion of the set request such as "pending, completed, and failed"

if the request has been completed you are able to view the html code for that particular website that you searched from

all of this needs to be stored in a database
